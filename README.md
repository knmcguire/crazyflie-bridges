# Crazyflie Bridges

> **_NOTE:_**  This repository is still experimental and is not considered part of the Bitcraze official ecosystem yet

This repository contains the code for the Crazyflie bridges. The bridges are used to connect the Crazyflie to different frameworks, like Zenoh, TCP, ROS2.

Currently the only example is:
* [Crazyflie](https://www.bitcraze.io/products/crazyflie-2-1/) to [Zenoh](https://zenoh.io/) bridge: This makes use of the [Crazyflie Python library](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/repository/crazyflie-lib-python/master/) and the [Zenoh Python API](https://zenoh.io/docs/apis/python/)
